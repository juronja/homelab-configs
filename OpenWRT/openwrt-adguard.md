# Setup a Adguard on openWRT

Adguard DNS and dnsmasq issues
If you use Adguard DNS as forwarder (to have a cheap and efficient network adblocker), you need to disable Rebind protection, to avoid lag or site unreachable due to Rebin protection.

If not, you can see lot of this log in system.log, and have lag or host unreachable issue.
